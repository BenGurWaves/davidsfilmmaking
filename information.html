          <h2>Bio</h2>

          <p>
            I am David Ivanyuck, a filmmaker and visual artist whose work straddles the line between experimental cinema and quiet narrative. My approach values texture and rhythm over tidy exposition; I aim to build frames that carry the weight of lived moments while still breathing like a piece of music. I treat the image as a place to keep memory and doubt in parallel — to let them sit in the same frame and watch what happens.
          </p>

          <p>
            My earliest work began in the margins: late-night experiments with found footage, phone camera tests, and small edits that taught me how to listen to images. Without formal textbooks dictating procedure, I learned by breaking things. Those mistakes are visible in the films I make — grain, stray light, and half-heard audio that together feel more human than anything polished to perfection.
          </p>

          <p>
            Collaboration has been my greatest teacher. Working with musicians, designers, and other filmmakers has sharpened my sense of timing and given me permission to be messy. I don’t make movies to impress; I make them to understand. Each piece is a conversation with a moment in time — a way to hold certain questions without pretending to have answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The work is often slow, sometimes brutal, and occasionally tender. It’s not a portfolio of hits; it’s a map of attempts. I keep making because the act of making changes how I recognize possibility. That hunger, more than praise or numbers, is what keeps me filming.

          <h2>Contact</h2>

          <p>
            For collaborations, commissions, or conversation: I prefer focused, intentional contact. If you’d like to talk about a project — anything from a concept-stage music film to a longer experimental piece — email is the clearest place to start.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:dfilmmaking@gmail.com">dfilmmaking@gmail.com</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            I work best with people who bring clarity of purpose and a tolerance for risk. That could mean a small budget and big ambition, or a long timeline and an unknown result. I’m open to travel for projects that need it, and I’m careful about what I say yes to — because time is the real budget.
          </p>

          <p>
            For quick glimpses of my process, work-in-progress clips, and visual notes, social channels are useful — but email remains the most reliable channel for real conversations.

          <h2>Archive</h2>

          <p>
            The archive is a living pile: early experiments, rough cuts, outtakes, collages, sound tests, and pieces that exist only as notes. It is not curated to feel “finished”; rather, it is a place to return to, rework, and reimagine. Some pieces remain as fragments because they are useful fragments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve learned to value process over prestige. Projects that were once abandoned often reappear as the seed for something new. The archive keeps those seeds — raw footage, audio scraps, and half-built edits — precisely because they remind me how the work is made.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’d like to see specific archive material, reach out; certain items are available for viewings or conversation. The archive is an invitation to see the artist as a maker of attempts, not only polished outputs.
