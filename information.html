        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I am David Ivanyuck, a filmmaker and visual artist whose work straddles the line 
          between experimental cinema and narrative storytelling. My approach is rooted in 
          texture, rhythm, and emotion rather than linear progression. Every frame is crafted 
          as if it could stand alone as a photograph, while together they form an audiovisual 
          poem. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began not in film school, but through late nights experimenting with 
          cameras, editing, and projection. This autodidact path gave me a unique visual 
          language—one that embraces imperfection, noise, and grain as living, breathing 
          elements in storytelling. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I collaborate with musicians, brands, and other artists to create work that 
          moves fluidly between commercial and personal, digital and analog, chaos and order.

          Interested in collaboration, commissions, or just a conversation? I’m always open 
          to connecting with creatives who share a love for film, photography, or experimental 
          media. Whether it’s a brand campaign, music video, or an independent art project, 
          I’d love to hear your ideas.

        <h2>Archive</h2>
        <p>
          My archive is a living organism—short films, visual studies, personal experiments, 
          and commissioned work all coexisting in dialogue. It is less of a gallery and more 
          of a diary: a place where polished projects meet raw sketches. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Each piece is part of a continuum. Sometimes I revisit old footage years later, 
          cutting it into new shapes, layering it with different sounds, or projecting it 
          onto unconventional surfaces. The archive is where I experiment freely, unbound by 
          deadlines or expectations. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it as a sandbox—messy, alive, and constantly shifting.
