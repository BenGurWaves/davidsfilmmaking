        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          David Ivanyuck is a filmmaker driven by an instinct to transform fleeting thoughts into images
          that linger. His practice weaves between experimental visuals, grounded narrative, and the
          unpredictable collisions between the two. He approaches film as both craft and diary, using
          motion pictures to translate the rhythm of his days into a language of light and shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born with a restless curiosity, he cut his teeth on short-form experiments before challenging
          himself to build larger works—projects that demand endurance, vision, and failure in equal
          measure. For David, art is less about arriving at mastery and more about surviving the stretch
          between doubt and discovery. Each film is an artifact of that survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          His influences are broad—painters, novelists, internet oddities—and each one leaves a trace.
          But what defines his work isn’t homage; it’s honesty. David builds films that acknowledge their
          own process, the fingerprints left behind, the fractures that hold the image together.

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          For collaborations, commissions, or questions, David welcomes genuine connections. He prefers
          dialogue over transactions, and thoughtful partnerships over quick fixes. Reach him directly:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> dfilmmaking@gmail.com</p>
        <p>
          While based primarily in [your city], his work is mobile and adaptable, capable of
          finding shape wherever a story needs to be told. Travel and remote collaboration are always
          possibilities, because filmmaking, at its core, is about movement—across landscapes, across
          lives, across ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social channels exist but are secondary; email remains the most direct and reliable form of
          contact. For those interested in supporting his work more informally, screenings and updates
          will be shared occasionally through newsletters.

        <h2>Archive</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond the polished projects lie dozens of unfinished fragments: tests of light, experiments
          in editing, collaborations that collapsed into memory. The archive is both a record and a
          playground—proof that process matters as much as final product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short films, essays, installations, and photo series all live here in various forms. Some are
          rough sketches, some are nearly complete. The archive reminds both artist and audience that
          film is alive, never finished, and always in conversation with itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selected works will surface over time, available through screenings or by request. These
          glimpses into the past provide context for the present, mapping out the growth, mistakes, and
          persistent obsessions that drive new projects forward.
