          Placeholder text for Bio. This section should read like a story, not just
          a blurb. Think of it as letting people step into David’s head — how he
          started, what he wrestles with, what keeps him coming back to film.

        <p>
          Write in long paragraphs, maybe 600–700 words total across this page,
          so the scroll has weight and feels cinematic in itself.

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          You can reach me at <a href="mailto:dfilmmaking@gmail.com">dfilmmaking@gmail.com</a>.  
          I’m open to collaborations, creative partnerships, and opportunities that push the medium.

      <section id="archive">
        <h2>Archive</h2>
        <p>
          This could house past works, stills, or even a text reflection on films that shaped David.  
          Each entry can become its own little vignette, giving weight to his influences.
